### 🔭 I’m currently working on a script to generate static web applications

#### Why?
Github generously provides free hosting for static web apps. This puts people one step closer to owning their own website.

The aim of this repo is to make sharing knowledge even easier. We're creating a script which will allow users to generate a website which compares
languages based off of datasheets they provide. Consider this a middle man to help tech-averse people make an impact.

It's also a great way for me and my friends to practice our coding skills (and project management skills when we have time)!

#### How?
We're keeping it simple by using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS for the frontend. Using web components and pollen css to keep it uniform.

For the functionality, we'll be using substring matching to add a search function at the start, [fuzzy matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching) as a stretch goal and display the rest of the generated web app in a simple manner.

An interesting point of discussion is how we'll load our data in order to keep load time down, so stay tuned for that!
